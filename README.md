# Sigma-Sprint

The Global Multichain Builder Competition.

## Track

• Create an app or tool using Sui technology, and deploy it on either Sui mainnet, or testnet.

• Wormhole integration is optional, but should demonstrate / outline how Wormhole could be incorporated.

• Projects that leverage Walrus for storage will receive additional points during evaluation.

## Wormhole

Through the cross-chain token transfer technology provided by Wormhole, multiple payment methods are supported to randomize Suikemon cards in future.<br>In the current project, the card is just a simple object. In the future, you can consider making it into an NFT, and then use Wormhole to give the extracted NFT across the chain.
